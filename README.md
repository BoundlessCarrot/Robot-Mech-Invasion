Robot/Mech Invasion

This game may or may not work. I have no idea. Honestly, I'm too lazy to test it. 

In the event that you download this game and...
  A) It works: Great! You've probably just wasted your time. Play it for like 5 minutes and delete it. 
  B) It doesn't work: In all honesty, you probably dodged a bullet. Delete the files and erese its existence from your memory. It's for your own good.
